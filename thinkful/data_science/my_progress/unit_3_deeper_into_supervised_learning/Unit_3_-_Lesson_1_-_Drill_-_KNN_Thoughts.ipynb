We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."

Two additional variables could then be created based on the scaled sums of the essential / non-essential variables.  We could then plot these derived variables in a scatter plot with a different hue depending on whether the customer paid on-time or not.\n",
